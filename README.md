## Overview
The Minecraft Recipe Calculator is a Python-based tool designed for Minecraft. It tells you how many items you need to make a specific recipe.

## Key Features
- **Recipe Creation**: Users can create custom recipes by specifying the name of the item and the ingredients required, along with their quantities. This now supports nested recipes.
- **Recipe Database**: Recipes are saved in a SQLite database, allowing for easy retrieval and management. This also helps in preventing the creation of duplicate recipes.
- **Ingredient Calculation**: The application can calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed based on the desired quantity of the final crafted item.
- **Recipe Browsing**: Users can view a list of all saved recipes and select one for ingredient calculation.
